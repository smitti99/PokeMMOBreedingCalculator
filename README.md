# PokeMMOBreedingCalculator
A Tree-builder for PokeMMO-Breeding

In order to breed you need atleast 2^(x-1) pkmn where x is the amount of values you want to breed (or nature)
if your pkmn has a gender you need at least 2^(x-2) pkmn of each gender where x is the amount of values you want to breed (or nature)

There can only be a maximum of two stats where you only have one pkmn

Nature has to be set with only 1 PKMN, otherwise it will be treated as a regular IV
If you have the exact amount of pkmn that are in theory needed there can only be 2 stats with an odd number of pkmn (male+female), 
for each pkmn more you can have one more odd number
